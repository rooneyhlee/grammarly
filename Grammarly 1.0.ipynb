Based on our discussion, Deloitte and cybersecurity aligned closely with my expectation of ideal career and my exceptional curiosity and creativity. So, I started researching the company and noticed that the requirements of cybersecurity Co-op resembled my dauntless and inquisitive approaches to intellectually stimulating challenges. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on Deloitte’s Changing faces of cybersecurity report, I identify as both a scientist and a hacker. I have always been passionate about finding life hacks. Always searching for creative workarounds and places where I can profit from various services. For example, I am independently developing a python program to use the majority of premium features of an online grammar checker, Grammarly. Also, in my technology-oriented master’s program, I am excelling in business processes, data and information infrastructures, and programming. Therefore, I possess great potential to develop strong security analysis skill with both my passion and skill sets. Within weeks, I will bring tangible value to Deloitte by creating innovative cybersecurity “hacks” to Deloitte’s clients as well.\n",

    "Furthermore, I developed strong leadership and teamwork skills during the competition and entrepreneurial project, where I persevered through demanding cooperation challenges. I maintained effective communications and relationships during these stressful environments by bringing my positivity and charisma.\n",
