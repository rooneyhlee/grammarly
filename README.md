This is a program that attempts to locate the premium errors for Grammarly.

For this program to work, the environment requires Selenium, chrome browser and chrome webdriver for Selenium

The content of the app can be inputted using either specifying the location of the docx file and using a docx extension on python (which needs to be installed)

or directly pasting the texts of the document into the content section of the app.

This app works by checking the change in the html content of premium error as the program inserts the keys into grammarly.

This work is in progress and I am aware of the weaknesses of my program, and I do not intend to make profit off this program and this is purely for my personal interest
